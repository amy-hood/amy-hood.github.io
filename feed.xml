How did I end up here (and why am I, as a former colleague once asked me, not a poet or a baker instead)? What do I see myself growing towards next (as all who know me know that I am fully committed to growing, rapidly and rigorously, towards <em>the next thing</em>)? And perhaps most importantly, how does all of this shape my approach to data work? I believe that the analysis can’t be divorced from the analyst, so consider this my longer-form introduction to me–and by extension, my approach to analytics and data work in general.</p> <h2 id="my-entrance-into-data">my entrance into data</h2> <p>I graduated college with minimal math exposure. No part of me identified as a “numbers person.” But the first full-time job I landed out of college–a Program Coordinator position for an evaluation team at large nonprofit–needed data skills to answer the financial questions I was responsible for knowing. So with nothing but a barely-supported edition of Oracle BI, an Excel license, and a grit I’ve come to love about myself, I set to figuring it out. I started with learning pivot tables in Excel. When I wanted the ability to see multiple tables in the same visualization, I graduated to data transoformation and modelling in Power BI. When I learned about databases, I sought out SQL bootcamps and consulting projects for practice. And when I finally was starting to feel something close to analyst, I dove into learning pandas and matplotlib in Python.</p> <p>While I was toiling away at specialization, that first job at Oxfam also helped me become a generalist. I took a 3-month visual design course, learned feminist theory from staff in the Gender Justice department, and used my Union professional development funds to start a project management professional (PMP) certification. I was also unknowingly building facilitation skills: I volunteered to organize the Staff Development Committee for our Union, co-chaired the Young Women Professionals Employee Resource Group (ERG), participated in the Gender Resource Network, and of course, led Data Pack. Oxfam was full of opportunities to learn, if you knew where to look, and I was on a scavenger hunt.</p> <p>Thankfully, nothing I’ve learned has ever been done alone. Every step of the way, there were colleagues with me, trying to solve a problem or learn something new. A big bolster to that was the introduction of data culture program to Oxfam. With the support of my boss at the time, I co-founded Data Pack, a staff-led community of practice dedicated to data. It started in 2019, with nine members trying to learn Power BI with a $20 Udemy course I had paid for out-of-pocket. When I left Oxfam in 2022, it had grown to 40+ members. We had two learning groups learning SQL, Power BI and Dedoose, supported by a $3k or so annual budget. We had delivered a dozen or so Data Pack projects, which matched data work to Data Pack members who wanted to learn a new data skill. We had built a theory of change together on how we saw ourselves contributing to a feminist data culture at Oxfam. We hosted social hours, problem-solving sessions, and feminist data ethics book clubs. Perhaps best of all, I designed a ridiculous logo inspired by the Three Wolf Moon t-shirt. (If you look closely, there are numbers in the background of the Data Pack logo, which was real Oxfam financial data copied and pasted into the background. A long-running joke with myself that data without context is just background noise.)</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/datapack_logo.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="250px" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/threewolfmoon_tee.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="250px" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The Data Pack logo, next to the <a href="https://www.bewild.com/products/three-wolf-moon-mens-big-face-t-shirt">style of 2000s t-shirts</a> that inspired it. </div> <p>Personally, I learned Power BI, SQL and (the start of) Python all through Data Pack funds and learning opportunities. Data Pack was transformational to my career, and whether or not it still exists at Oxfam today, it was really special. You can learn more about Data Pack in the Harvard Data Science Initiative talk I gave in 2021, available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O_DIl0fJzU">Youtube</a> starting at about 23:21.</p> <h2 id="taking-the-analyst-title">taking the (analyst) title</h2> <p>After almost six years at Oxfam, I had begun to question the role of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs)–and perhaps more importantly, my role in them–so I started looking for other opportunities. In May 2022, I accepted full-time Analyst position at the City of Boston, working on the performance management team. The initial nervousness I felt around my experience level faded as I learned that the problems Oxfam had faced were common across large organizations. The skills I had built in my previous role–in relationship and project management, in translating stakeholder needs into analytic products, in data visualization design, in supporting staff to use data to drive decisions, in facilitation–were all relevant. The only difference was that the City employs some 20,000 employees instead of a few hundred.</p> <p>That size and scale of the City’s workforce afforded a unique opportunity to test the staff-led model for data culture started by Data Pack. In November 2022, I led our first data culture pilot at the City: an 11-session learning cohort on JavaScript with 22 staff, using freeCodeCamp as our curriculum. It was a knockout success, earning a 4.7 satisfaction rating from participants, and producing many <em>bbgs</em> (baby bar graphs). Those familiar with d3.js will hopefully share our pride in getting bars-on-page, just a few months after starting to learn JavaScript from scratch:</p> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/bbgs.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> The JavaScript pilot's collection of baby bar graphs, which we built in d3. </div> <p>We delivered a total of four learning cohorts in 2023, including JavaScript. One was in Python fundamentals, and two more were dedicated to learning Power BI as part of the City’s transition to the tool. Overall, 55 unique staff across the City completed 50% or more cohort in 2023. Through all of this, I also earned a promotion to Performance Manager. My new role increased opportunities to build the strategy of the Performance Management team, and advance the goal of telling the story of the City’s performance through data.</p> <h2 id="looking-ahead">looking ahead</h2> <p>So, what next? I don’t think it’s necessarily a terrible thing to not be fully committed to a direction. I know where my interests lie:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Expanding My Analytic Toolkit:</strong> I genuinely love building data tools, and there is no limit to learning something new in this arena. I’m interested in continuing to tinker in Python with packages I have yet to try out, refreshing my stats knowledge, keeping my SQL skills sharp, and allowing myself space to follow my fancies. This includes adding to my tools and tricks to better apply feminist approaches to data work!</li> <li><strong>Facilitating Great Data Conversations:</strong> I’m proud of the facilitation skill set I’ve built over time, and I’d love to continue to support people to use data in their work through intentional convening. This can take many forms (and doesn’t necessarily require a professional setting!).</li> <li><strong>Building Additional Domain Expertise:</strong> The data world is large, and I’m eager to see how data is being used across a variety of socially-minded contexts, including in the private sector. What questions do other industries often ask of their data? What skill sets do they preference?</li> <li><strong>Exploring Strategy:</strong> I’m learning how much I enjoy-and have experience with, and excel at–imagining what could be, and laying out the path to get there. Data Pack, and the City’s Data Culture Program, have all had some combination of strategic plans, performance measures, and theories of change. I’m looking for opportunities and projects than enable me to take on increased responsibility in developing and delivering on strategy. I’m particularly interested in applying this lens to organizational data culture work.</li> <li><strong>Learning Feminist Leadership:</strong> I’m continually obsessed with the building blocks required to be a fantastic feminist leader in the workplace. I’m curious to find ways to evaluate my own leadership skills, and identify areas for growth, as well as exploring non-hierarchical leadership opportunities.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="about"/><category term="career"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[reflecting on my path to data work]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a future place for data thoughts?</title><link href="https://amy-hood.github.io/blog/2024/a-future-place/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a future place for data thoughts?"/><published>2024-01-20T12:03:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-20T12:03:00+00:00</updated><id>https://amy-hood.github.io/blog/2024/a-future-place</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://amy-hood.github.io/blog/2024/a-future-place/"><![CDATA[<p>Well, it’s the new year! While I’m a firm believer that change does not come on a calendar’s schedule, I also love that this time of year is often accompanied by reflection and a deep (if not entirely warranted) optimism. In that spirit, I’m hoping that 2024 can be the year I return to writing, in both professional and poetic capacities. So consider this a very-visible placeholder in hopes that it will soon be replaced by some data thoughts - on visual design for data visualization, on feminist data ethics practices for analysts, on data culture work.</p> <p>I’m looking forward to it. :smile:</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="links"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[setting some intentions for 2024]]></summary></entry></feed>
